# Pull Request Summary

## Restoration of Solidity Files
- Restored `CCIPReceiver.sol` from the snapshot taken two days ago.
- Ensured the file was originally imported from a Chainlink repository dealing with NFT transfer via CCIP.

## Updates to `.gitignore`
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules` directory, following best practices for Next.js projects and to prevent potential pre-rendering errors on Vercel.

## Preparation for Deployment
- Addressed React hydration errors to ensure proper rendering of components.
- Created mock POAP API endpoint for testing without the actual API key.
- Refactored `EventAttendanceVerification.tsx` to use `useCallback` and `useEffect` for improved performance and reliability.
- Ensured all components are rendering correctly and the dapp transitions through stages as expected.
- Completed the build process with necessary environment variables set for deployment on base sepolia and optimism sepolia.
- Resolved import errors in `pages/404.tsx` and `pages/recent.tsx` to ensure functionality post-deployment.
- Pushed all changes to the remote repository on the branch 'restore-ccipreceiver.sol'.

## Next Steps
- The dapp is now ready for deployment on base sepolia and optimism sepolia.
- Further testing on the specified networks is recommended to ensure full functionality.
