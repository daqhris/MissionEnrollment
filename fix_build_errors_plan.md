# Plan to Fix Build Errors

## 1. Update Dependencies
- Ensure all packages are up-to-date and compatible with Next.js 14.2.7
- Focus on `wagmi`, `viem`, `ethers`, and `@wagmi/core`

## 2. Resolve Import Errors
- Update imports in:
  - EventAttendanceVerification.tsx
  - config.ts
  - useScaffoldWriteContract.ts

## 3. Address ESLint Errors
- Fix issues in poapVerification.js:
  - Convert require statements to import statements
  - Remove unused variables

## 4. Update TypeScript Configurations
- Ensure tsconfig.json is properly configured for the project

## 5. Refactor Code for Compatibility
- Update usage of ethers and wagmi hooks across the project
- Ensure all components are using the correct imports and API calls

## 6. Run Local Build
- Use `yarn build` to test the build process locally
- Address any new errors that arise during the build

## 7. Final Verification
- Run ESLint across the entire project
- Perform a final local build to ensure all issues are resolved

This plan will serve as our roadmap for systematically addressing all build errors and ensuring compatibility across the project.

## 8. Changes Made
- Updated POAP IDs in EventAttendanceVerification.tsx and poapVerification.ts
- Improved error handling and logging in verifyIdentity.ts
- Modified POAP verification process to handle multiple POAP IDs
- Updated dependencies in package.json
- Created new test files for POAP verification

## 9. Pull Request Summary
These changes address the faulty implementation of onchain lookup for POAP ownership, improve the search process to prevent browser crashes, and update the dapp to correctly retrieve and display POAPs after wallet connection.

## 10. Next Steps
- Review and test the changes thoroughly
- Ensure all build errors are resolved
- Update documentation if necessary
- Create a pull request when access to git commands is available
