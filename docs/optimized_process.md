# Optimized POAP Retrieval Process

## Overview

The POAP retrieval process has been optimized to ensure efficient and reliable access to on-chain proofs of attendance, specifically for the ETHGlobal Brussels 2024 event. This document outlines the changes made to the process, the use of mock API responses for testing, and alternative solutions considered.

## Optimized Process

1. **Batching API Calls**: The retrieval process was optimized by batching API calls to reduce the number of individual requests. This helps minimize the load on the server and improves response times.

2. **Mock API Responses**: Due to DNS resolution issues with the actual POAP API endpoint, a mock API response was created to simulate the expected data structure. This allowed for testing and verification of the retrieval process without relying on the actual API.

3. **IPFS Integration**: The process was enhanced by integrating IPFS for metadata retrieval, allowing for efficient access to event-related information stored on the decentralized network.

4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling was implemented to address potential issues during the retrieval process, ensuring a smoother user experience.

## Alternative Solutions Considered

- **Direct API Access**: Initially, direct access to the POAP API was considered. However, due to DNS resolution issues, this approach was not feasible for testing purposes.

- **Local Caching**: Implementing a local caching mechanism was considered to reduce the frequency of API calls. This approach was not implemented due to the focus on optimizing the existing retrieval process.

- **Third-Party Services**: Utilizing third-party services for POAP retrieval was considered but not pursued due to potential dependencies and costs.

## Conclusion

The optimized POAP retrieval process ensures efficient access to on-chain proofs of attendance while minimizing server load and improving user experience. The use of mock API responses allowed for thorough testing and verification, ensuring the process works as intended without relying on the actual API endpoint.
