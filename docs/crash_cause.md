# Identified Cause of Heavy Load and Browser Crashes

## Overview

The `fetchPoaps` function in the `EventAttendanceProof.tsx` component is responsible for fetching and processing POAPs for a given user address. This function is a critical part of the "attendance" stage of the web dapp and has been identified as a potential cause of heavy load and browser crashes.

## Function Details

The `fetchPoaps` function performs the following steps:

1. **User Address Validation**: It checks if a user address is provided. If not, it sets an error message prompting the user to connect their wallet.

2. **Loading State**: It sets a loading state to indicate that the POAP retrieval process is in progress.

3. **API Call**: It makes an API call to fetch POAPs for the given user address. The API endpoint is `/api/fetchPoaps?address=${userAddress}`.

4. **POAP Processing**: It processes the fetched POAPs to find a specific POAP related to the "ETHGlobal Brussels 2024" event. If found, it triggers a verification callback and displays a success message. If not found, it displays a warning message.

5. **Error Handling**: It handles various error scenarios, including API errors, network errors, and unexpected errors, displaying appropriate error messages to the user.

6. **Loading State Reset**: It resets the loading state once the process is complete.

## Potential Issues

- **API Call Overhead**: The function makes an API call to fetch POAPs, which can be resource-intensive, especially if the response contains a large number of POAPs. This can lead to heavy load and potential browser crashes.

- **Inefficient Processing**: The function processes the fetched POAPs to find a specific event-related POAP. If the number of POAPs is large, this processing can become inefficient and contribute to performance issues.

- **Error Handling**: While the function includes error handling, it may not adequately address all potential error scenarios, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Recommendations

- **Optimize API Calls**: Consider optimizing the API call to reduce the amount of data fetched or implement pagination to handle large responses more efficiently.

- **Improve Processing Logic**: Refactor the POAP processing logic to handle large datasets more efficiently, potentially using more performant data structures or algorithms.

- **Enhance Error Handling**: Review and enhance the error handling logic to ensure all potential error scenarios are adequately addressed.

By addressing these potential issues, the heavy load and browser crashes in the "attendance" stage can be mitigated, leading to a smoother user experience.
