# Insights from PR #88 Review

## Overview

The review of PR #88 provided valuable insights into potential improvements for the POAP retrieval process. These insights are crucial for enhancing the efficiency and user experience of the web dapp.

## Key Insights

1. **IPFS Integration**: The PR highlighted the integration of IPFS for metadata retrieval. This approach allows for decentralized access to event-related information, reducing reliance on centralized servers and improving data availability.

2. **Batching API Calls**: The PR emphasized the importance of batching API calls to minimize server load and improve response times. This technique is essential for handling large datasets efficiently.

3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling was a focus in the PR, ensuring that potential issues during the retrieval process are addressed promptly. This leads to a smoother user experience and reduces the likelihood of crashes.

4. **Mock API Responses**: The use of mock API responses for testing was highlighted as a way to circumvent DNS resolution issues. This approach allows for thorough testing and verification without relying on the actual API endpoint.

## Relation to Current Optimization Efforts

- The current optimization efforts have already incorporated IPFS integration and batching API calls, aligning with the insights from the PR.
- The focus on error handling and mock API responses has been reinforced by the PR review, ensuring that these aspects are adequately addressed in the optimization process.
- The insights from the PR have guided the development of a more efficient and reliable POAP retrieval process, ultimately enhancing the user experience.

## Conclusion

The review of PR #88 has provided valuable insights that have been integrated into the current optimization efforts. By focusing on efficiency, error handling, and decentralized data access, the web dapp's POAP retrieval process has been significantly improved.
